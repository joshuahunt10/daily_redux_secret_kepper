# React App with Redux Using Async Functions
----
## Technical Accomplishments
1. The app will POST and GET from an API.
2. The app uses Redux to manage a global state when the user logs in.
3. The app uses async functions to login, authenticate, and pass the user to a part of the app behind a login wall
4. The app creates a cookie so the user does not have to re-login
5. The app has a logout that destroys the cookie and redirects the user out of the user details page.

## Issues Overcome
1. Setting up redux for the entire app was a challenge.
2. Integrating the newly learned async functions into the redux furthered the complexity
3. This was my first time using a cookie to store a users log in information.
